products have been an important part of diets for thousands of years, from early humans

important trees, such as mango and apple.

A  paperclip,  made  of  steel  wire  bent 
in
to  a  hooped  shape,  is  an  instrument  used  to  hold  sheets  of
 
paper together. Th
is common 
  
3
1
  
 
is a wonder 
of simplicity and function. But
 
where did this simple, 
cheap, and indispensable invention
 
come from?
 
In the late 
19
th
 
century, the most common way to hold papers together was by using a pin. Although 
the pin was an inexpensive 
tool and was easily 
  
3
2
 
 
,
 
it would leave holes in the paper. Later
,
 
as steel 
wire  became  more  common,  inventors  began  to  notice  its  elastic  feature.  With  this  feature,  it  could  be 
stretched  and 
  
33
  
 
various  clip
-
like  objects.  In  the  years  just  prior  to
 
1900,  quite  a  few  paperclip 
designs  emerged.  The  name  most  frequently 
  
34
  
 
the  paperclip  invention  is  Johan  Vaaler,  a 
Norwegian inventor. However, Vaaler’s clips were not the same as the paperclips currently in use. 
Specifically, they did not have 
the
 
i
nterior loop
 
we see today. The 
  
35
  
 
looped design was invented 
by Gem Manufacturing Ltd. in England. This clip is therefore sometimes 
  
36
  
 
the Gem clip.
 
Because of Vaaler, the paperclip played an important 
  
37
  
 
role in Norway. During World War II, 
No
rway  was  occupied  by  the  Nazis.  Norwegians  were
 
prohibited  from  wearing  any 
  
38
  
 
of  their 
national  unity
,
 
such  as  buttons  with  the  initials  of  their  king. 
Th

they  started  wearing 
paperclips to show their solidarity. The  reason  for doing thi
s  was simple: Paperclips  were  a  Norwegian 
invention whose original function was to bind together. After the war, a giant paperclip statue was erected 
in Oslo to

In 2009, the  Taiwu Elementary 
School Folk Singers  were  invited  to perform in Belgium, France, 
Germany, and Luxemburg. In 2011, they were voted
 
as
 
one of the world’s top five performance groups 
by audiences of Japan Broadcasting Corp
oration
’s Amazing Voice program. 
 
Recalling the group’
s  first tour in  Europe,  Camake
 
Valaule,  a  physical  education  teacher  and  the 
founder of the Taiwu 
E
lementary School Folk Singers, admitted that he felt very nervous. He was worried 
that  the  audience  would  fall  asleep 
since
 
most  of  the  75
-
minute  performance
 
was  a  cappella, 
that  is, 
singing  without 
instrumental
 
sound.  Surprisingly,  the  audience  listened  with  full  focus  and  high  spirits. 
Camake
 
said, “They told me afterward t
hat  through our  performance,  they  had  a  vision of our  country, 
our village, without having to visit it. This experience greatly boosted our confidence.” 
 
    
According  to  Camake
 
Valaule,  singing  traditional  ballads  has 
helped
 
students  and  their  parents  to 
re
-
understand their culture. “It used to be that the only ones who could sing these songs were tribal elders 
aged  between  50  and  60.  Now  with  the  children  performing  the  pieces,  parents  are  beginning  to  ask, 
‘Why do we not know how to sing the
se
 
ballads?’ 
Many times nowadays, it is the children who teach the 
songs to their parents, putting back
 
the pieces of a blurred memory
.
” 
 
Winnin
g  international  fame,  however,  wa
s  neither  the  original  intention  nor  the 
main  reason  why
 
Camake founded the group
 
in 2006. T
he most important thi
ng wa
s to make children understand why they 
sing  these  songs  and  to  preserve  and  pass  on  their  culture.  Referring  to  the  relocation  of  Taiwu 
Elementary School and Taiwu Village 
following
 
Typhoon Morakot in August 2009, Camake said, “We
 
could not take  the  forest or our houses  in the  mountains  with us; but we  were  able  to bring our culture 
along. As long as the children are willing to sing, I will always be there for them, singing with them and 
leading them to

When it comes to medical care, many patients and doctors believe 
“
more is better.
”
 
But what they do 
not realize is that overtreatment
—
too many scans, too many blood tests, too many procedures
—
may pose 
harm. Sometimes a test leads you down a path to more
 
and more testing, some of which may be invasive, 
or to
 
treatment for things that should be left alone.
 
Terrence Power, for example, complained that after his wife learned she had Wegener’s disease, an 
uncommon disorder of the immune system, they found it 
difficult to refuse testing recommended by her 
physician.  The  doctor  insisted  on  office  visits  every  three  weeks,  even  when  she  was  feeling  well.  He 
frequently  ordered  blood  tests  and  X
-
rays,  and  repeatedly  referred  her  to  specialists  for  even  minor 
compla
ints.  Even  when  tests  came  back  negative,  more  were  ordered,  and  she  was  hospitalized  as  a 
precaution when she developed a cold. She had as many as 25 doctor visits during one six
-
month period. 
The couple was spending about $30,000 a year for her care.
 
Aft
er several years of physical suffering and near financial ruin from the medical costs, the couple 
began questioning the treatment after consulting with other patients in online support groups. “It’s a really 
hard thing to determine when 
they
’ve crossed the
 
line,” Mr. Power said. “You think she’s getting the best 
care in the world, but after a while you start to wonder: What is the objective?” Mr. Power then spoke 
with his own primary care doctor, who advised him to find a new specialist to oversee Mrs. Powe
r’s care. 
Under the new doctor’s care, the regular testing stopped and Mrs. Power’s condition stabilized. Now she 
sees the doctor only four or five times a year.
 
4
5
.
 
What is the main idea of this passage? 
 
(A) Treatments do not always cause harmful side ef
fects.
 
(B) Patients tend to believe more testing is better treatment.
 
(C) 
T
oo 
much
 
medical 
care

Bresson (1908

2004) is one of the most original and 
in

Bresson believed that all editing should be done when the
 
photo
 
is 
taken
. In 1952, his first 
book, 
The  Decisive  Moment
, a rich collection of his work spanning two decades, was published. “There is 
nothing in this world that 
does not have a decisive moment,” he said.
 
In 1968, he began to turn away from photography and return

ust 
standing and moving around, throughout the day is enough to bring the increased levels back down. And those 
small  amounts  of  activity  add  up

30  minutes  of  light  activity  in  two  or  three

be  just  as 
effective as a half

hour block of exe
rcise. But without that activity, blood sugar levels and blood pressure keep 
creeping  up,  steadily  damaging  the  inside  of  the  arteries  and  increasing  the  risk  of  diabetes,  heart  disease, 
stroke, and 
other
 
serious diseases. In essence, fundamental changes i
n biology occur if you sit for too long. 
 
But wait, you’re a runner. You needn’t worry about the harm of 
a 
sedentary
 
lifestyle
 
because  you
 
exercise regularly
, right? Well, not so fast. Recent studies show that people spend an average of 64 hours a 
week sit
ting, whether or not they exercise 150 minutes a week as recommended by W
orld 
H
ealth 
O
rganization 
(WHO)
.  Regular  exercisers,  furthermore,  are  found  to  be  about  30  percent  less  active  on  days  when  they 
exercise. Overall, most people simply aren’t exercising
 
or moving around en
ough to counteract all the harm
 
that can result from sitting nine hours or more a day.
 
Scared straight out of your chair? Good. The remedy is as simple as standing up and taking activity breaks.
